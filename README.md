## Laravel E commerce 

This git repository was created to showcase an e-commerce store, where each products belongs to a category and the products can be added to a cart. Only the Admin can add products.

The products can be bought or checkedout via Paystack and Flutterwave. Although the store has a login and registration system, guests can chekout products by adding their name and email only.
